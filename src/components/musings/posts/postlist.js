# My Inspiration

Over the course of my very limited existence, I have taken an interest in tinkering —I still remember the first Nerf Gun I have modded. In recent years, though, I have taken a greater interest in philosophy and, by extension, politics, where I have continued this exploratory mindset. In my journey through philosophy and politics, I have gone from right to left numerous times in an aim to be both as intellectually honest and as consistent as possible. This website acts as a tool for me to ensure that I am genuinely doing that. On this website, I attempt to rigorously outline my current stance on everything from moral psychology to abortion. Of course, my positions will change —just as they have hundreds of times before— and I will update them accordingly, but going back and physically rewriting sections will help me track how much I actually have changed. It will allow me to see how far I have come, and I can look back at my mistakes and flawed reasoning and learn from them.

Not to mention this allows me to rant about the garbage state of politics as we know it :)

# On Selfless Altruism: Critiquing a Master

---

Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., was the leader of the human genome project and is an incredibly well-respected physician-geneticist. He is also a man of devout faith and wrote an entire book about making the scientific argument for faith called *The Language of God*. Overall, the book is incredibly well-argued, but he makes one argument in particular that at first glance, seems strong, but upon closer inspection, doesn't comport with the current scientific consensus on the subject. Namely, Dr. Collins is incorrect in his assertion that the existence of "Moral Law" implies the existence of a divine creator and that within our current scientific paradigm, it is unreasonable to believe that such a thing could have occurred naturally.

In the first chapter, Dr. Collins poses the following argument: "Agape, or selfless altruism, presents a major problem for the evolutionist" because "it cannot be accounted for by the drive of individual selfish genes to perpetuate themselves" (Collins 27). He goes on to propose three possible counterarguments: (A) "repeated altruistic behavior of the individual is recognized and a positive attribute in mate selection," (B) "Indirect reciprocal benefits have provided benefits to the practitioner over evolutionary time," *or* (C) "Altruistic behaviors by members provides benefits to the whole group" (Collins 27, 28). Notably, Dr. Collins seems to treat these things as mutually exclusive, then argues against each individually. This assumption makes absolutely no sense, though; any combination of the three could be contributing to the existence of selfless altruism. Altruism indirectly benefiting the group doesn't *magically* prevent it from also being useful in mate selection.

There is one other key assumption that Dr. Collins makes: that selfless altruism exists in the first place. This is definitely a far more contentious topic among the philosophical and psychiatrist communities than Dr. Collins first lets on. As Neel Butron, M.D., explains:

>["altruism has many benefits for the altruist. Carrying out an altruistic act leaves us with a feeling of euphoria…. [and] altruism is associated with better mental and physical health and greater longevity…[it is] [n]o surprise, then, that many psychologists and philosophers argue that there can be no such thing as true altruism, and that so-called empathy and altruism are mere tools of selfishness and self-preservation" (6, 8).](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201203/does-true-altruism-exist)

For many experts, it is not clear that true altruism —what Dr. Collins would call "selfless altruism"— even exists. The keen reader may have noticed that Dr. Burton's reasoning is based around present-day selfless altruism and doesn't say anything about how such selfless altruism came about, and so might wonder how altruism may have arisen in humans in the first place. Why would a creature be altruistic before that "feeling of euphoria" was a part of them? This quandary has a simple answer: the feeling of pleasure that causes us to engage in "selfless" altruism is the evolutionary byproduct of reciprocal altruism —altruism that benefits all parties.

Reciprocal altruism is not an uncommon phenomenon within the animal kingdom. That is to say, it is not unusual for animals from their species and even different species —we all learned about symbiosis in grade school, for God's sake (or not). Examples of this include ["mutual grooming among many birds and mammals"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/reciprocal-altruism) and ["cleaner fish clean[ing] the mouths of larger fish, which in turn refrain from eating them."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/reciprocal-altruism) However, there is still a large hurdle to get over for more complicated forms of reciprocal altruism to develop: animals need to be able to both recognize one another in the future and trust that their kindness will be repaid. Hence why it has been observed that ["many of the human psychological characteristics have evolved for us to be able to cheat, to detect cheaters, and to avoid being detected if cheating"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/reciprocal-altruism). Early humans were altruistic because they knew that they would get something in return. Think about it, would you loan money to a complete stranger without either of you even knowing what each other looked like? No, how would they ever repay you? Though, you would probably do so in a society in which it was normal to loan strangers money because you would expect that when you need it, other strangers will help you (not just the ones whom you’ve helped). Selfless altruism doesn't exist. Rather, it is just indirect reciprocal altruism. It’s like Social Security: the young help the old so that they will be helped when they are old.

So-called selfless altruism is not just unique to humans, though. Researcher and Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan, Felix Warneken, performed a Harvard-published a study comparing altruistic behavior in children and chimpanzees —the ["last common ancestor of apes and humans" (1)](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12285465/The%20Development%20of%20Altruistic.pdf;sequence=1). In the study, they presented both 18-month old infants and chimpanzees with ["ten different situations in which an adult was having trouble achieving a goal" (2)](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12285465/The%20Development%20of%20Altruistic.pdf;sequence=1). The researchers found that, like the 18-month-old toddlers, ["chimpanzees would also help their caregiver when she was reaching for an object" (6).](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12285465/The%20Development%20of%20Altruistic.pdf;sequence=1) Furthermore, ["[c]himpanzees performed these acts of helping without being offered a reward"](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12285465/The%20Development%20of%20Altruistic.pdf;sequence=1) and ["did not pick up the objects in matched control conditions in which there was no indication by the caregiver that she needed help"](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12285465/The%20Development%20of%20Altruistic.pdf;sequence=1) (6). This was enough for Warneken to conclude that ["chimpanzees also have the cognitive and motivational prerequisites to perform acts of instrumental helping"](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12285465/The%20Development%20of%20Altruistic.pdf;sequence=1) (7). The study shows a clear counter-example to Dr. Collins’ assertion that Moral Law and selfless altruism are even unique to humans.

A different study by Michael Balter, Carel van Schaik, and their colleagues measured the likelihood that different animals would help each other get treats and found that there was ["a close linear correlation between the degree to which a species engages in cooperative breeding and the likelihood that members of the group would help fellow animals get the food treat"](http://www.science.org/content/article/human-altruism-traces-back-origins-humanity). They were also able to determine that other factors —["such as higher cognition (measured by brain size), hunting in groups, or stronger social bonds between group members"](http://www.science.org/content/article/human-altruism-traces-back-origins-humanity)— were poor predictors of altruistic behavior. This provides evidence for counterargument (A) —that altruism is recognized as a positive attribute in mate selection. Now is probably a good time to mention Dr. Collins' counter-counterargument to counterargument (A): "the practice of infanticide by a newly dominant male monkey" (Collins 28). This argument is underwhelming at best: obviously, one un-altruistic practice doesn't disprove the evolutionary basis of altruism. There are many competing evolutionary drives that all interact with one another. Just because altruism is preferable in mate selection doesn't mean that there aren't also other drives that could win out over altruism in specific cases. It is also completely possible that selfless altruism has only partially developed in monkeys. Maybe altruism hasn't won out in monkeys yet, but it still exists in other animals, and there are indicators that monkeys possess the capacity for altruism. We wouldn’t look at monkeys, observe that they can’t talk, then say that speech couldn’t have evolved in humans. And we definitely wouldn’t observe their current methods of communication (nonverbal ones) and use those to conclude that humans never could have developed verbal communication by evolution alone. That would be preposterous.

In the end, though, Dr. Collins' argument falls short at the foundation. The veracity of our explanation of the origins of altruism doesn't say anything about divine intervention. A more religious reader has probably heard the term "God of the Gaps" thrown by atheists like Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, and Sam Harris. Sure, their approach is certainly not the most fruitful, and they engage in their own sort of "Atheism of the Gaps" in which they assume that lack of evidence for God means that there is no God, but, fundamentally, they are correct: just because science can't explain something yet doesn't mean that a supernatural being did it. It is perfectly fine to believe that we don't have the answer right now. Truly, we don't. There are so many competing theories about the origins of selfless altruism in humans and animals, which I never even touched on. The most compelling of which I have come across is proposed by the psychologist Jonathan Haidt. He argues that societies are to organisms as organisms are to cells; the societies with the most evolutionarily beneficial Moral Law survive while those without Moral Law do not. He essentially makes argument (C) with bits and pieces of arguments (A) and (B). I attribute this argument to Haidt, but to be clear, every single contemporary evolutionary psychologist whose work I have read agrees that altruism has evolutionary roots. Still, I implore readers to look into the subject further. The existence of a creator is one of the fundamental existential questions of human existence. Some would even say it is *the* fundamental question of human existence, so it is vital to have your own answer.

# Taxes * Snore *

## My Policy

Money does buy happiness. Sort of. More precisely, it is a barrier to happiness. It is really hard to be happy with no money, but that doesn’t mean one will necessarily be happy with money. Based on the current research, emotional well-being steadily increases with income level, but it is believed “[that beyond about $75,000/y, there is no improvement whatsoever in any of the three measures of emotional well-being.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1011492107#fig01)” Of course, we cannot infer that money *causes* greater happiness, but we can say that more money seems to be associated with greater happiness. I believe that this association stems from a lack of money being a significant stressor. The way I think about it is that people have some baseline level of happiness when they have every opportunity they could ever want. This baseline varies from person-to-person because some people have more or less drive to take up these opportunities. The less money you have, the more stress this causes, so it takes away from people’s baseline level of happiness. Around $75,000, though, money is no longer a significant stressor and you have most of the opportunities that money is going to give you, so you are brought up to your baseline level of happiness, but no further.

Because of this, I believe in a more progressive tax system. I am open to the idea of raising capital gains tax, but there is [some evidence to suggest that such a policy would discourage investment, meaning it might actually be better to reduce the capital gains tax](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b3116098-c577-4e64-8b3f-b95263d38c0e/the-economic-effects-of-capital-gains-taxation-june-1997.pdf). It seems as though raising the income tax rate on higher-income workers will not significantly reduce their productivity, and it will increase the productivity of formerly impoverished workers and free up their wallets to buy goods and services which they would otherwise be unable to afford. Such a process stimulates the economy, leading to the taxed money actually being returned to the taxed parties (and then some) —[possibly “actually boost[ing] long-run growth if increased public saving (or, more accurately at present, decreased public dissaving) outweighs any decrease in private savings, as some economic research suggests.](http://epi.org/publication/raising-income-taxes/)” Trade is not a zero-sum game, nor are taxes.

Furthermore, one wouldn’t necessarily need to raise the rate of each individual tax bracket, we could just add more tax brackets instead. This wouldn’t raise as much revenue, but it would at least help and be more palatable to a more conservative audience.


## Common Critiques

### “The Government Wastes Money”

The argument has been brought up that the government wastes tax money, so we shouldn't give them more to waste. This argument is interesting but doesn't actually meaningfully address whether we should make taxes more progressive. Policies that help the impoverished still need to be implemented in one way or another, so unless another, more efficient solution is proposed, pointing to the inefficiency is useless; this would be like saying that we shouldn't move to renewable energy because solar panels are only "[between 15% and 18% efficient](https://www.vivintsolar.com/learning-center/how-efficient-are-solar-panels#:~:text=Most%20figures%20say%20that%20solar,like%20it%20would%20anything%20else.)." Additionally, I don't know of a single person who advocates for a more progressive tax system that believes that we shouldn't also streamline our bloated federal government. Even if it turns out that we could have solved all of our problems with our current tax revenue, increasing taxes *now* will still get us there faster. We can increase taxes now as we streamline the government so that we are helping the people who need it right now; then, once we have streamlined the government, if we find that we don't need such high taxes, then we can bring them down again. Raising taxes and making the government more efficient are not mutually exclusive. The government's inefficiency is not an argument against making taxes more progressive; it is an argument in favor of making the government more efficient.

### “Taxation is Theft”

Yes, it is, but not all theft is bad. [I build my morals off of reciprocated values](https://davidangell.dev/musings/my-philosophy); it can be thought of as a more rigorous form of the “Golden Rule.” The difference is that all rules are universalized (i.e., Rule Utilitarianism). This gets around some of the really irrational parts of Act Utilitarianism which measures the outcome of a single action within a single context. So, I would say that we should murder people because I wouldn’t want to be murdered, and in order for other people to not murder me, I agree not to murder them, and they agree not to murder me; the values are reciprocated. Applying this to taxes, if I were poor, I would want aid from the government to help me out of my poverty, and if I had a high enough income, I would be willing to give that up because it means that my impoverished self would be helped. So this becomes a rule: it is fine to increase the taxes on those who can afford the increased taxes while still living comfortable lives. Because the economic evidence seems to show that a more progressive tax rate helps the poor without significantly harming higher-income households, I think that it is fine to “steal” this money.

### “The Rich Avoid Taxes”

It has also been brought up that the rich will just avoid the taxes. Again, this does not actually address the argument. Not a single person advocating for a more progressive tax system wouldn't also be in favor of streamlining our tax code such that there are fewer loopholes. Furthermore, if the rich can really so easily get around taxes, then aren't they just not paying taxes now? Increasing taxes wouldn't change that. It's not like we will magically receive less tax revenue. Now for some people, this might matter —especially those of us who think that we ought to tax the rich because taxing them is inherently moral— but I don't fall into that camp. Just as before, we can increase taxes now (or even add more tax brackets) while streamlining the tax code at the same time. The rich avoiding taxes is not an argument against making taxes more progressive; it is an argument against letting the rich avoid taxes.

## My Criteria for Jokes

### My Sole Criterion

Fundamentally, I believe that any interaction whose effects are limited to the people who give informed consent to said interaction is morally neutral —in other words, it is neither good nor bad. For example, I think that gay sex is fine between consenting adults because both parties are capable of giving informed consent, but I don’t think that sex is fine between an adult and a child because a child is incapable of giving informed consent. I wouldn’t, however, say that consensual gay sex is “good” or that consensual straight sex is “good” because that doesn’t make any sense; it is just neutral. This principle applies to every interaction in life, including humor.

### Extending My Criterion to Dark Humor

My criterion works for normal humor, but it gets a bit muddier for dark humor. Firstly, let me make it clear that I define dark humor as “humor that is viewed as dark, morbid, cruel, offensive to some, and or graphic in nature.” The key issue with dark humor that distinguishes it from other forms of humor is [its ability to reinforce negative stereotypes](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368430213502558). This means that the effects of dark humor are not always limited to just the people making the jokes: if I tell a racially insensitive joke to a friend, and this makes them more likely to express their negative stereotypes in the form of voting for a candidate who enacts policies that hurt the Black community, the joke has now affected people who didn’t consent to the joke in the first place; this would also be true of someone who gets comfortable making racially insensitive jokes and goes on to make a racially insensitive joke in a context that hurts someone, leading to a non-consenting party being affected by the original joke. Intuitively, I think that this makes sense to most people —nobody wants to make jokes with a *genuinely* racist person. All of these are implications of my sole criterion, but it takes a lot more brainpower to think all of this through before making a joke, so here are my modified criteria that are derived from my initial criterion:

1. All immediate parties give informed consent to the joke
2. The people engaging with the joke have made a meaningful effort to ensure that they are not unintentionally reinforcing negative stereotypes in any immediate parties (including themselves)

# ACAB: A Lesson in Needlessly Divisive Phrasing

---

Lately, I have been thinking about how the phrasing of one’s message can affect its interpretation. I personally try to look beyond the exact words someone uses; instead, I try to understand where they were coming from. For the majority of people, however, word choice does matter. This is never more true than in politics. This is why politicians will never actually say anything; instead, choosing to leave their statements up to interpretation and allow the listener to graft their own beliefs onto what is being said. ACAB violates this rule, but not in a good way. The argument that leads many to conclude that all cops are bad/bastards goes as follows:

1. The system allows bad people to become cops and gives cops too much power; therefore, the system is flawed.
2. All cops participate in this flawed system; therefore, all cops are bad/bastards.

I will not say whether this logically follows because it doesn’t matter. The solution to the police problem is obviously to fix the flawed system in one way or another, regardless of whether participation in the system makes cops bad/bastards.

This is where the phrasing of ACAB finally comes in. Whether or not you agree with ACAB, it creates division rather than unification —something which should be self-evident given how I had to preface the previous clause. It changes the conversation from one about fixing the system to one about whether all cops indeed are bad/bastards. The system being flawed isn’t a partisan issue. Both sides have different solutions, and both should be heard out. Solutions should be the focus of the discussion, but when the idea is put out there that all cops are bad/bastards, many people feel like they have to defend the good cops. That argument is futile: Even if one side gets the other to concede, the discussion just goes back to one about fixing the system, which was very the thing that everyone agreed upon anyway. Saying ACAB just derails a productive conversation and directly inhibits our ability to actually achieve social justice.
